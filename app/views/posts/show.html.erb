Information About the Post
<%= render partial: "authors/author", locals: {post_author: @author} %> <!-- because we are calling a partial from outside the current folder, we must specify the folder -->
<!-- we are passing the render method as key-value pairs -->
<!-- the first key-value pair shows the name of the partial to render -->
<!-- the second specifies the locals as a HASH-->
<!-- the Hash's keys (post_author) will be created as local variables within the partial -->

<%= @post.title %>
<%= @post.content %>
